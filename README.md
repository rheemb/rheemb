# Hi 👋, I’m Raheem Abdul.
I’m a tech nerd who’s worn many hats over my 4+ years in tech - think Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Business Analyst, and more. I’ve worked at places like Amazon, LTIMindtree, UConn Health and now at Wells Fargo, always bringing my top-notch communication skills and can-do attitude to the table. I’ve got a Master’s in Business Analytics and Project Management from University of Connecticut (UConn) ("Go Huskies" 🐺🐾), and I’m all about turning data into solutions that make an impact and building pipelines as a smooth operator (an F1 nod to my calm demeanor).

### 🔭 What I’m Working On
I’m building AI agents to automate my to-do list and daily schedule—basically making my day more productive! I’ve also got some personal projects on my local setup, just dusting off, waiting to be done, but I’m swamped with a lot of things right now.

### 🌱 What I’m Learning
I’m doing code-along sessions to level up my Python, SQL, Spark and dashboard building skills while contributing to NGOs. Also digging into Graph Databases (like Neo4j) and Kubernetes for scaling data pipelines in the cloud.

### 🌍 A Bit About Me
I’ve been a tech enthusiast since my bachelor’s, where I was also a big environmentalist. Numbers sparked my interest in coding and data, coming from an engineering background. I worked on a Thermoelectric Generator (TEG) project using human warmth to power wearable devices (yep, you can charge without power, just through body heat)—check out my publication [here](https://www.academia.edu/38185187/Wireless_Charge_of_Wearable_device_Using_HUmanwarmth_pdf). I also occasionally attend tech conferences to stay in the loop. I’m still into sustainability and love working on tech that’s ethical and efficient.

### 🫱🏼‍🫲🏼 Let’s Collaborate
I’d love to team up on projects around scalable data solutions, AI applications, or sustainable tech. If you’re into building ETL pipelines, automating workflows, green tech, or any human cause through tech, hit me up!

### 🛠️ Tools I Know
- **Languages**: Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL, R, Java  
- **Data & Viz**: Power BI, Tableau, Looker, D3.js  
- **Big Data & ETL**: Spark, Airflow, Kafka, Databricks, Snowflake, dbt, Hadoop, AWS Glue, Azure Data Factory  
- **Cloud & DBs**: AWS, Azure, Snowflake, PostgreSQL, GCP (BigQuery)  

### ⚡ In My Free Time
I’m a sports junkie—F1, Basketball, football (not the US one), Tennis, and Cricket are my go-tos! I also love hiking and joining local sustainability activities to stay connected to my environmentalist side. If you’re a huge movie lover, hit me up with your favorite character reference so I can catch up.

### 📫 Let’s Connect!
I’m always down to connect with tech enthusiasts who share my passion for Data Engineering, AI, and sustainable tech. Hit me up about ETL pipelines, data visualization with Power BI or Tableau or breaking into data roles! I’d also love to collaborate on projects around scalable data solutions, AI, or green tech. I’m looking for full-time roles as a Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Business Analyst, or anything that fits my experience in data and cross-functional work. My communication skills and can-do attitude make me a great partner for brainstorming and driving projects forward.
